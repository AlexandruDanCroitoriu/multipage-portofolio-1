        "p1": "I've loved building things for as long as I can remember. Growing up in Romania during the rapid digitalization of the 2000s, I witnessed firsthand how technology could transform businesses and lives. That early fascination led me to write my first lines of code at age 12, building a simple website for my father's business.",
        "p2": "The real turning point came during my studies at Politehnica University in Bucharest, where I dove deep into distributed systems and cloud architecture. After graduating, I spent several years working with some of the world's leading tech companies, contributing to products used by millions of users daily.",
        "p3": "In 2022, I founded TechNova with a vision: to build a platform that makes cloud-native development accessible to every European business, regardless of size. We're creating tools that simplify deployment, scaling, and monitoring, allowing developers to focus on building great products rather than wrestling with infrastructure.",
        "p4": "Today, I split my time between growing TechNova, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing what I've learned through articles and conference talks. I'm passionate about Vue.js, serverless architectures, and helping the Romanian tech community grow. When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking in the Carpathian Mountains or exploring Bucharest's vibrant coffee scene."
